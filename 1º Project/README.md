  * Master  - code ready to class delivery OR finished iteration
  * Develop - the main branch where the source code of HEAD always reflects a state with the latest delivered development changes for the next release.
  * Release - this branch support preparation of a new production release. This should be the one interaction with master. Bug are done here.
  * Feature - this is the branch where new features are created.
